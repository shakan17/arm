=================

This module is intended to teach ARM AARCH64 Instruction set Architecture

Instructions :
=============
1. To compile the program, run :  make clean  &&  make
2. Refer compilation steps to get executable name, run program as ./<executable>
3. To disassemble of the program, view <executable>.dis . Note objdump is used to convert executable to assembly file
