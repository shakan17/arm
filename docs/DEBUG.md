# Debugging Guide for GDB and Eclipse on ARM platforms
This guide will provide instructions to build ARM 64-bit linux binaries and debug on ARM platforms

# Contents

1.	Installing ARM AARCH64 GCC toolchains.
2.  Compiling and disassemble ARM 64-bit linux binaries
3.	Debugging an application using GDB command prompt.
4.	Debugging an application using Eclipse.


## 1. Installing ARM AARCH64 GCC Toolchain
The latest Linaro Linux GCC toolchains for ARM 64-bit linux platforms can be downloaded from [here](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest/aarch64-linux-gnu/)
* Example [Download GCC 6.3](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/6.3-2017.02/aarch64-linux-gnu/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.02-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz)
* Untar the toolchain package into ~/tools/linaro directory : _*tar -xJf gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.02-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz*_
* Update the PATH variable in terminal/shell : *export PATH=$PATH:~/toolchain/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.02-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/*
* Compiler : _*arch64-linux-gnu-gcc*_
* Objdump  : _*arch64-linux-gnu-objdump*_


## 2. Compiling and disassemble ARM 64-bit linux binaries

* Export the GCC toolchain binaries path in PATH variable as shown above
* To compile a program, use : *arch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static  program.c -o program.axf  *  (_Note static is used to overcome any library depoendancies in your target_)
* To disassemble the binary , use arch64-linux-gnu-objdump -d program.axf > program.S
* Refer Makefile in one of the programs in aarch64-asm folder for more details

## 3. Debugging an application with GDB

### 1.	Installing gdb-multiarch

The host needs a cross-debugger to debug an application running on the target. GDB (GNU Debugger) has a version which supports multiple architectures (such as ARM, MIPS, â€¦) named gdb-multiarch.

#### 1.Install GDB and GDB multi-architecture:
*sudo apt-get install gdb
*sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch 


### 2. Debugging with GDB

GDB is a text-debugger common to most Linux systems. For remote debugging, we will run gdbserver on the target, and the cross-debugger (gdb-multiarch) on the host.

1.  Build your project using the -g option to ensure the file gets debug symbols.
	1.This likely means adding the -g option to your CFLAGS variable in your Makefile.
2.  Install GDB server on the target:
	1.apt-get update
	2.apt-get install gdbserver

3. On the target, change to the directory where your application is (assumed to be named
helloWorld), and launch gdbserver:
	1.gdbserver localhost:2001 helloWorld

It should look like the following (pid likely to be different):
	1.gdbserver localhost:2001 helloWorld
	2.Process helloWorld created; pid = 1068
	3.Listening on port 2001

4.  On the host, in the directory of your helloWorld executable, launch the cross-debugger:
	1.gdb-multiarch -q helloWorld

5.  At the GDB prompt "(gdb)", type in the following command to connect to the target:

	1.(gdb) target remote 192.168.0.102:2001
	2.Change the IP address to the IP address of the target.
	3.The host should look like this:
		1.gdb-multiarch -q helloWorld
		2.(gdb) target remote 192.168.0.171:2001
		3.Remote debugging using 192.168.0.171:2001
		4.warning: Unable to find dynamic linker breakpoint function. GDB will be unable to debug shared library initializers and track explicitly loaded dynamic code.
		5.0x400007b0 in ?? ()
		6.(gdb)

	4.The target should now have displayed the additional line (your IP will be different):
	5.Remote debugging from host 192.168.0.188

6. You now have a GDB session. You should be familiar with the following GDB commands, Refer [GDB Commands Cheat Sheet](http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)
	1.list, frame, quit
	2.info breakpoints, break main, break lineNumberHere, delete 1
	3.continue, print myVar, step, next
	4.bt, info args, info frame, info local, up, down
	5.Control + C (to interrupt program when running).
